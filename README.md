#### To start the project run:

```
npm run serve // write in the root of the project folder
```

---

#### If you'll get error like this:

```
sh: ... concurrently: Permission denied
```

Try to delete folder :package: node_modules and write:

```
npm i (same as the "npm install")
```

In most cases this solution work.

Have a good day ! :octocat:
